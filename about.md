**My name is Ã“scar and my passion is learning new stuff.**

*Other smaller more specific passions include cooking, art, design, music, dancing, v-games and many more.*

Hi there! Thanks for passing by. ðŸ¤©

At this point of my life, I'm a chemist.
Since I graduated in 2018 my interest has been slowly gravitating towards the fascinating world of math, data and programming.
On June 2019, after finishing the first course of a master's degree on Theoretical Chem., I decided that I would spend the following year studying and training to be able to land a data science job before the end of 2020.
Follow me as I find my way though spreadsheets, graphs and neurons, while advancing my variety of other interests.
We'll surely learn something!
